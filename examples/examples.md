## Bash examples

**example-1**  
User is asked to pass size of reading array, and then to enter numbers. Program sums numbers and prints result.  
User can select to exit or to continue with another array.

**example-2**  
There is src folder that contains files. take all JS files (there are other types as well) and merge them in one file. Also, before each segment, in resulting file, there should be header that says `# File: ${filename}`
